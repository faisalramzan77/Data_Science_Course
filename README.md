#  Data Science Course

I am currently learning Data Science. This repository is where I save everything I practice, including Python code, notebooks, notes, and projects. I use it to track my progress and understand important concepts step by step. Each topic I add here helps me build a better understanding of how data works, how to clean and analyze it, and how to use it to make predictions. This repo is a personal learning journal where I track my progress and practice different topics as I grow my skills in Data Science.
